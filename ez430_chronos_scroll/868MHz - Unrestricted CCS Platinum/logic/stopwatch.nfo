These functions may be recursive:
	mx_stopwatch()
	stopwatch_tick()
	sx_stopwatch()
	stop_stopwatch()
	display_stopwatch()
	start_stopwatch()

Making this function inlineable: start_stopwatch()

Making this function inlineable: stop_stopwatch()

Making this function inlineable: reset_stopwatch()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	memcpy()
	start_buzzer()
